notion-config
=============

Here's my configuration for the excellent [Notion Window Manager](http://notion.sourceforge.net/).

The meat of the configuration is in cfg_notioncore.lua.  Where possible, I avoid using modes and just try to have everything useful mapped to META plus a single key.

Notion is released under the LGPL v2.1 with additional restrictions relating
to the name. All settings here that are my own work are likewise released under
the LGPL v2.1.
